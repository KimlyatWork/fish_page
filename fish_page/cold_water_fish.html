            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cold water fish thrive in cooler water temperatures, typically between 50-70°F (10-21°C). They are known for their hardiness and ability to live in unheated tanks, making them popular choices for both beginners and experienced aquarists. Common examples include goldfish, koi, and white cloud mountain minnows. These fish are often kept in ponds or large aquariums and are appreciated for their vibrant colors and active behaviors. Cold water fish require clean, well-oxygenated water and a proper diet to maintain their health and longevity.</p>
